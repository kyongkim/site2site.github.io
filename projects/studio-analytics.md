##STUDIO ANALYTICS

A grid of sensor inputs is embedded within Studio-X that will allow for insertion of an array of sensors that will collect information and create a foundational database system for analytics and interactive solutions. 
###Description

![Scenario GIF] (https://raw.github.com/yz2428/site2site.github.io/master/images/Vibe/studio-x_ANALYTICS.gif)

Scenario with microphone sensors: Tapping into the constant hum of the workplace, the microphones are able to extract a range of information about the different uses of a space based on qualitative and temporal aspects associated with sound.

![Plan Schematic] (https://raw.github.com/site2site/Studio-Analytics/master/Images/SA-schematic.jpg)

This particular scenario is comprised of a distributed, discreet network of microphones within the Studio-X space which are able to measure the frequency, intensity, and duration of sound rather than focus on content.

With this information, we may be able to map particular zones of interest, or utilize the quantitative information generated through this process as a basis for interaction with other proposals.
